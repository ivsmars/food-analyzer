# Food Analyzer
Course project for the Modern Java Technologies course.  
Project description: https://github.com/fmi/java-course/blob/master/course-projects/food-analyzer.md.

## Setup
- You'll need a free API key since the server communicates with the FoodData Central API.
  You can get one [here](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup.html).
- Specify the port on which the server will run and provide your API key in an "api.properties" file in the root.
  Template is provided in [api.properties.example](api.properties.example).
